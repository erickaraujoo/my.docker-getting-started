## :books: About Docker

Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containersâ€”standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

<strong>Access the Docker documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)</strong>

## :information_source: How to use

First, clone the project with the command below:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/erickaraujoo/my.docker-getting-started.git
```

With docker installed on your machine, use the command below in the terminal

``` docker
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Now open the application in your browser by accessing `localhost:3000`
